These 8 samples demonstrate our technique, LoopGen, compared to its closest baseline: continuing a MusicGen track using Magnet and looping it back on itself.

The samples are divided into two groups: 4 tracks generated by the baseline method and 4 tracks generated by LoopGen. Since LoopGen also continues prompts generated by MusicGen, one pair of samples shares the same initial segment (namely, "baseline_rock" and "ours_rock"). The others are generated with different starting prompts, all generated with musicgen.

To make it easier to detect any seams, all loops are repeated twice, with the seam naturally located at the midpoint of the sample.
